## Benefits of moving projects to the MNF

1. **Shared community ownership**

    When projects are owned by individuals working at a company, the ownership can become unclear when they leave, resulting in the project withering. When a project is owned by an individual, it's easy for them to lose interest in maintaining it over time. MNF owned projects are entirely community-driven making it easy to onboard new contributors over time. This allows contributors to continue to drive projects even if they change companies. This helps remove single points of failure in the community to help ensure important projects can live longer.

2. **Community standardization**

    One of the primary goals of the MNF is to improve mobile infrastructure for everyone. Providing high quality, useful open source projects is a huge part of this. Currently it's common to see multiple companies open source many different implementations of similar ideas. We hope the MNF can be a place where the community can collaborate on single solutions to important problems and standardize them.

3. **Resources**

    The MNF can potentially contribute resources for things like CI support for projects in the organization. The details of this should be discussed before the project is donated to make sure significant costs can be covered.

4. **Engineering Culture**

    Many organizations use open source contributions as a way to boost their public engineering image. This helps with recruiting and growing engineers who are interested in open source work. Donating a project shows that your organization heavily invests in the open source community. It also improves the chances of long term success of the projects you build your business on. Finally it shows you’re interested in what’s best for the community, even if you choose to stop investing in the project.
