The Mobile Native Foundation is governed by the Technical Steering
Committee (TSC). This document outlines the processes the committee
follows, and the process to becoming a committee member.

## Responsibilities

The TSC admits and oversees all projects in the Mobile Native Foundation
and has a mandate to facilitate driving consensus for:

- Defining and maintaining the technical vision for the Mobile Native
  Foundation
- Approving new projects within the scope for Mobile Native Foundation,
  aligning projects, removing or archiving projects

## Process

### General

- The TSC consists of 12 members serving a 2 year term.
- One member of the committee is selected by the TSC as the chair. The
  committee chair is responsible for setting agendas and calling
  meetings.
- The current committee members are listed in the [CONTRIBUTING
  file](https://github.com/MobileNativeFoundation/foundation/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING)
- Members should nominate a secondary. The secondary should participate
  in TSC meetings and discussions, especially in the case of scheduling
  conflicts.
- The TSC meets monthly to discuss outstanding issues. Notes will be
  posted from the TSC meetings as [discussion
  topics](https://github.com/MobileNativeFoundation/discussions/discussions/).

### Joining

- When there is a vacancy on the TSC, nominations for new members are
  solicited in a GitHub discussion. Any contributors to the Mobile
  Native Foundationâ€™s projects or discussions can nominate someone for
  the TSC.
- The existing TSC members will vote from the nominations.

### Voting

- Quorum for TSC meetings requires at least fifty percent of all voting
  members of the TSC to be present.
- Each member can vote in favor, against, or abstain.
- Proposals approved by a majority of cast vote (ties are therefore
  against).
- A member and their secondary comprise a single vote.
